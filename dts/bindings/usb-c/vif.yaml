    A VIF node is a root element that describes the Qualifying Product in VIF
    specification. It contains introductory material followed by an optional
    product-level field element, zero or more Components, and zero or more
    Optional Content elements.
    This is based on VIF XML file schema in:

                1 - Cable
                2 - Repeater
            This feild is required for defining any/all of the members below i.e,
            /VIF/Certification_Type

            What is the USB-IF certification category under which the Qualifying
            Product is to be submitted? This field shall be set to the same value as
            the one on the USB-IF Product Registration form.
            If /VIF/VIF_Product_Type is set to 0 (Port Product), then valid options
            are:
                0 - End Product
                1 - Reference Platform
                2 - Silicon

                2 - Silicon
            If /VIF/VIF_Product_Type is set to 2 (Repeater), then this field shall be
            set to 2 (Silicon).
            If /VIF/VIF_Product_Type is not present, then this shall not be present

    component:

        required: false
        description: |
            0 or more components that fully describe a component of the Qualifying
